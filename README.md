# Sprayduino
Aurduino based automotive nitrous system controller

Reads analog voltage from a 5 volt Throttle Position Sensor(TPS) or a microswitch on the throttle
and will turn on or off a nitrous systems solenoids. 

Will provide 5v to power an independant TPS.

Transbrake input - inhibit activation while transbrake is engaged.

Activation delay timer - on trans brake release.

#Future plans
  Read engine RPM from tach.
  
  Window switch - minimum and maximum rpm for activation.
  
  A safety timeout - shut off after n# seconds.
  
  Option to start delay timer from WOT.
  
  PWM control of solenoids?
  
  Better organize and fix the mess of code I created.
  
  Create PCB.
