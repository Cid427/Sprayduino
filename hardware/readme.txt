Hardware schematics have not been tested by myself, but since they have been borrowed from other existing projects they should work.

The tach input schematic is from,
https://github.com/chippernut/ShiftLightV2_1
This is an arduino shift light.

The TPS, Battery Reference, and Power Supply is from Speeduino,
https://github.com/noisymime/speeduino
This is an arduino engine management project.

Future plans are to design the PCB.
